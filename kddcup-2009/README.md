# kddcup-2009

Doing some training excersises on the 2009 kddcup data:

https://www.kdd.org/kdd-cup/view/kdd-cup-2009/Data

This dataset is discussed in the book [Data Science for Business](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-for/9781449374273/) which I am currently reading and enjoying. In order to get a little more out of the discussion I apply the methods myself the way I am use to and see how the scores compare (without spending too much time on optimizing parameters and feature engineering).

The source data is not privided with the repo. It can be downloaded manually from above website, or you can run the shell script inside this driectory.

## Work in progress


## Results for AUC:

On small dataset:

- Decisiontree: ~0.69
- Naive Bayes: ~0.58 (modelling potentially has some issues and can be improved)
