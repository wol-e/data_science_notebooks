Some code to analyze what food is good for a baby :D

This notebook aims to understand the difference in a vegetarian diet for infants as opposed to the regular diet. Initial version is based on the suggested meal plans for both a 'normal' and a vegetarian diet for infants as recommend by the german institute "Bundeszentrum für Ernährung". 

Will extend this readme hopefully and put the insights in here some time soon. Spoiler: A vegetarian diet for a kid is basically fine when taking care of some simple guidelines.
